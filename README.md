In this assignment, I created a simple registration form. The First and Last name rows are side by side. I decided to add other rows of information and also put them side by side. The Navbar is sticky and responsive to collapse on smaller screen to a Hamburger menu. I worked on an image for a good amount of time. The ribbon is the only image that I could find to not link to a webpage and just to the image, in order to work in bootstrap. I put in a reset button that dissapears on collapse to a smaller screen. In the hard data form at the bottom, I included three fictional names to showcase the operation of the forms responsiveness.
